## YOUR WORKFLOW (Daily)

### Writing a Blog Post:

**In your IDE (same one you use for Claude Atlas):**

```bash
# 1. Create new file
touch _posts/2026-02-21-analysis-title.md

# 2. Add front matter + content
---
title: "Your Analysis Title"
date: 2026-02-21
category: analysis
excerpt: "Brief description"
---

Your Markdown content here...

# 3. Commit and push
git add _posts/2026-02-21-analysis-title.md
git commit -m "New post: Analysis title"
git push origin main

# 4. Live in 60 seconds
```

### Managing Drafts:

```bash
# Keep unpublished posts in _drafts/
touch _drafts/work-in-progress.md

# Work on it, commit to save
git add _drafts/work-in-progress.md
git commit -m "Draft progress"
git push

# When ready, move to _posts/ with date
mv _drafts/work-in-progress.md _posts/2026-02-25-work-in-progress.md
git add .
git commit -m "Publish: Work in progress"
git push
```

## ADVANTAGES OVER WORDPRESS

### What You Gain:

✅ **Speed:** 4 seconds → 0.3 seconds load time
✅ **Cost:** $15/month → $0/month
✅ **Security:** No WordPress vulnerabilities
✅ **Reliability:** GitHub uptime > 99.95%
✅ **Simplicity:** No plugin conflicts
✅ **Control:** Full code access
✅ **Performance:** Global CDN included
✅ **Version Control:** Git tracks every change
✅ **Portability:** Markdown files = future-proof
✅ **Workflow:** Same IDE as Claude Atlas

### What You Lose:

❌ WordPress admin panel GUI

But you get:
- Markdown (cleaner, faster to write)
- Your existing IDE (better writing environment)
- Git workflow (same as Claude Atlas)
- No web interface lag
- Offline writing capability

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY ALIGNMENT

### Your Hub-and-Spoke Model:

**HUB: elliottmattice.work** (you own it)
- Long-form analysis posts
- Framework documentation
- Position papers (PDFs)
- Newsletter archive (future)

**SPOKES: Drive traffic back**
- LinkedIn: 300-word excerpts + link to full post
- YouTube: Video analysis + link to written version
- Newsletter: Expanded content + CTA to site

**Why this works:**
- You own the content (not renting LinkedIn)
- Build email list on YOUR site
- Google ranks YOUR domain
- Content persists (LinkedIn posts fade)
- Monetization control (frameworks, advisory)
